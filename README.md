# UI Testing & Development

> Welcome to UI Testing B. An ongoing curated list of frameworks, books, articles, talks, screencasts, recordings, libraries, learning tutorials and resources about React Native Framework Development. Thanks to all contributors, you're awesome and wouldn't be possible without you! Our goal is to build a categorized community-driven collection of very well-known resources.

### What Is UI Testing?
* **User interface or UI testing,** also known as *GUI testing,* is the process of testing the visual elements of an application to validate whether they accurately meet the expected performance and functionality. By testing the GUI, testers can validate that UI functions are free from defects.

#### The main aspects checked in UI testing include:

- Visual Design
- Functionality
- Usability
- Performance
- Compliance

## UI Testing Checklist: Essential Test Cases

Like most types of software testing, the scope of GUI testing can be very broad. In this section, we put together essential test cases that can help QA professionals test their interfaces thoroughly. The test cases cover different UI aspects, including images, color standards, page content, navigation, usability, and more. Use this checklist to ensure your UI tests are more exhaustive.

- Data type errors – Ensure only valid data can be entered for specific data types such as currency and dates.
- Field widths – If a certain text box permits a specified amount of characters, then make it clear on the user interface that the data entered shouldn’t exceed the character limit. ( For instance, a field that allows 50 characters in the application’s database should not allow users to enter more than 50 characters on the interface).
- Navigational elements – Verify all navigational buttons on the page are working correctly, and that they redirect users to the right page or screen.
- Progress bars – When displaying screens that take time to render results, a progress bar should be used to show the user that a process is still running.
- Type-ahead – If your UI uses drop-down lists, ensure you include type ahead. In a drop-down menu with hundreds of items, typing the first letter should skip the list to items beginning with that letter such that users will not have to check through a long list.
- Table scrolling – If data in your tables extends to another page, then the scroll function should allow users to scroll the data but keep all headers intact.
- Error logging – When the system experiences a fatal error, ensure the application writes the error details to an event viewer or log file for later review.
- Menu items – Ensure the application only displays valid menu items that are available at a particular state.
- Working shortcuts – For applications that support shortcuts, verify whether they work correctly, no matter the browser, platform, or device being used.
- Confirm action buttons – Ensure the UI has working confirm button every time the user wants to save or delete an item
